Learning by doing
So why am I doing this? My long term goal is to become a programmer and entrepreneur. Create my own business and be my own boss, while also remaining creative and build things with code. In the meantime I hope to spend the next two years or so, studying and practicing writing code. After than I hope to be good enough to land a relevant job to get experience working with others on bigger projects. Maybe if all goes well I can contribute to open source projects to get more experience in the meantime.

Current focus(august 2021): Learning Python well. Are taking the HarvardX course CS50x, have bought and read several books (inkluding but not limited to: Python programming for beginners, The self-taught programmer, Learn Python 3 the Hard Way, Learn More Python 3 the Hard Way). I also intend to finish two Udemy courses, and I have enrolled in more of the HarvardX courses avaliable at edX. 

My background
I have a MSc in Physiology. I wrote my thesis on thermoregulatiion in Reindeer. After that I have worked as everything from social media marketer at the university of Troms√∏, to working as a veterinary technician at a small animal clinic. Currently I am employed as a medical secretary at a private clinic.
